<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h5>
<p>This paper re-considers social status in contemporary Britian by duplicating prior analysis from Chan and Goldthorpe (2004, 2007). I analyse the occupational structure of marriage, cultural consumption, friendship closeness, and monopolistic acquisition to construct a measure of social status. This measure is directly compared with the Chan-Goldthorpe scale and the Cambridge scale to make theoretical and empirical arguments in favour of using my measure as an appropriate Weberian determinant of social status. This paper examines the relationship between social status and the epiphenomenal role it has with education, income and social class. I also identify multiple models based on economic life chances, cultural consumption, social attitudes, and behaviours to directly compare multiple status-based measures. As regards to my measure of social status, evidence suggests that this measure is much more sensitive compared to alternatives and more adequately captures the status/class relationship evidenced in British society and outlined in Weberian social theory. This new social status measure captures a more accurate Weberian distinction of social status and builds upon important empirical literature set out in the work of Chan and Goldthorpe (2004, 2007).</p>
<p>Key Terms: Social Stratification, Social Status, Weber, Social Class, Life Chances, Cultural Consumption, Friendship, Marriage</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Social stratification in British sociology is dominated by discussions of social class. Whilst there has been a resurgence in discussing social status as its own unique concept (Chan and Goldthorpe, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2010; Goldthorpe, 2012; Baumann, 2019; Chan, 2019c, 2019b, 2019a; Hanquinet, 2019; Karademir Hazır, 2019; Lambert, 2019; Laurison, 2019; Lizardo, 2019; Paalgard Flemmen, Jarness and Rosenlund, 2019), debate has mostly centred on one or two operationalised measures.</p>
<p>This paper seeks to open the debate once more by first critiquing conceptually, then producing empirically a contrasting measure to the most dominant conceptualisation of social status within British sociology – social status as defined by Chan and Goldthorpe (2004, 2007), henceforth defined as the Chan-Goldthorpe scale.</p>
<p>The Chan-Goldthorpe scale purports to be a measure of social status that derives itself from Weberian social theory. Weber differentiates social class, social status, and party as three main forces of stratification (Weber, 2019). Weber defines status groupings as real ‘communities’ compared with social classes that are not. Every component of positive or negative social estimation of honour makes up an individual’s status situation. That estimation of honour derives itself from an expected style of life and behavioural acts in accordance to those within the same social ‘circle’, the formal mode of cultivation, and the prestige of birth and/or occupation (Weber, 2019). These behavioural acts are monopolised through restrictive social closure via occupational sorting and material goods and opportunities, and are reified through social intercourse and inter-marriage (Weber, 2013). The monopolisation of goods and opportunities especially provides status qualifications and disqualifications dependent upon the level of status privilege one’s grouping belongs to. The performance of specific occupational labour, for example manual over non-manual labour is restricted to a less privileged status situation (Weber, 2013). Whereas social class is stratified according to the relations of production and acquisition of goods, social status is stratified according to the principles of the consumption of goods and styles of life (Weber, 2013).</p>
<p>This paper formally contends with the Weberian distinction of social status, for other debates surrounding other theoretical orientations of status see (Baumann, 2019; Hanquinet, 2019; Lizardo, 2019). Weber clearly defines four key aspects of social status. The first is a social circle that is derived through occupation and reified through homophilic association via either friendship or intermarriage. The second, related to the first, is a form of social intercourse within these closed communities. The third, is a form of monopolistic acquisition of key goods and opportunities that provide differentiating circumstances. The fourth, is the type of consumption individuals engage in, that is dependent upon their status situation. These four key concepts are what define Weberian social status.</p>
<p>The primary contention of this paper is that whilst the Chan-Goldthorpe scale is a good starting point, it does not fully account for a Weberian definition of social status. The Chan-Goldthorpe scale is solely operationalised around the occupational group and friendship associations. The scale itself adopts the Weberian view that “An occupational group is normally considered a status group as it normally successfully claims a type of social honour only by virtue of a special style of life” (Weber, 2013: 193). This justification can be found in Chan and Goldthorpe (2004), albeit under the auspices of adopting the approach pioneered first by Laumann (Laumann, 1966, 1973; Laumann and Guttman, 1966). Chan and Goldthorpe thus justify their approach based on two assumptions, the first is that “in modern societies occupation is one of the most salient characteristics to which status attaches” (Chan and Goldthorpe, 2004: 385). The second assumption is that the “recurrent association is a good indicator of a state of social equality between individuals and is, moreover, a better indicator of such quality” (Chan and Goldthorpe, 2004: 385).</p>
<p>This paper contends that the Chan-Goldthorpe scale relies only partially upon a Weberian framework of social status and as such any claim to “return to Max Weber’s distinction between class and status…” (Chan and Goldthorpe, 2007: 512) presents an erroneous view of a ‘Weberian’ measure of social status. This paper does not disagree with the assumption that occupation is the most salient characteristic to which status attaches itself too, however by failing to account for the other aspects of a Weberian definition of social status there is a likelihood to produce imprecise conclusions based upon a partial Weberian measure of social status.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>To fully account for a return to Max Weber’s distinction of status, the inclusion of all four key definitional aspects needs to be considered. The methodological route that Chan and Goldthorpe (2004) have taken, is a viable starting point. This paper will partially adopt the methods set out in their prior work by conducting Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDSCAL) (Bartholomew, Steele and Moustaki, 2008) – though this paper takes the view that marriage formations is a much stronger identification of homophilic association rather than friendship. MDSCAL analysis will take place and the resultant dimensions will be directly compared with the Chan and Goldthorpe (2004) paper. The basic data consists of a contingency table constructed of current occupational title of individual versus current occupational title of partners. This contingency table then provided a matrix of dissimilarity that was then used in multi-dimensional scaling (MDSCAL) methods. This method follows a similar pattern as laid out in other papers. First ‘outflow’ percentages were calculated from the contingency table, which was used to construct a matrix of marriage partners by occupational title. This provided the index of dissimilarity using the half-matrix at the diagonal to input into MDSCAL analysis.</p>
<p>A comparison will be made between the Chan-Goldthorpe scale, my own scale construction, and the introduction of another scale that does not claim to measure social status but social distance – the Cambridge scale. These three scales will be standardized and compared to one another to assess the viability of the claims made in Chan and Goldthorpe (2004, 2007) that their measure on its own, is a measure of social status.</p>
<p>Following this comparison of measures, this paper departs from the methodology of Chan and Goldthorpe and attempts to construct a measure of social status that consists of all four key aspects of Weberian social status: homophily, closeness, cultural consumption, and monopolistic acquisition. To do this, this paper uses exploratory factor analysis with an orthogonal rotation. This new measure of social status is then directly compared to the Chan-Goldthorpe scale using their own tests set out in Chan and Goldthorpe (2004). This paper then extends this comparison by duplicating some of the analysis in Chan and Goldthorpe (2007).</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h2>
<p>To best duplicate and compare the work set out in Chan and Goldthorpe (2004), this paper predominantly uses the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) wave 10 (year 2000). The BHPS is a complex panel survey and as such, whenever any data analysis took place the appropriate adjustments were made for complex survey data using the ‘svy’ package in Stata and also using the appropriate cross-sectional weights including all samples. Analysis is restricted to individuals aged 20-64. In wave 10 of the BHPS respondents were asked their own current occupational title, alongside their partners. These data were then coded into three-digit Standard Occupational Codes (SOC) 90. These codes could then be reduced down to 31 major occupational groupings in a similar fashion to Chan and Goldthorpe’s (2004) paper. The sample provided by the BHPS was generous (n=4,769). The social status scores provided by the BHPS sample are then applied to the 31 major occupational groupings in subsequent analysis. Analysis of the social status measure continues to use the BHPS wave 10 with a sample N=</p>
<p>This paper also makes use of the British Social Attitudes Survey 2001 in order to duplicate some findings from Chan and Goldthorpe (Chan and Goldthorpe, 2007). Whilst the aforementioned paper in their analysis uses the 2002 British Social Attitudes Survey, this paper found it more attractive to use the 2001 survey for the reason that the 2002 survey adopts SOC 2000 rather than the original SOC 90 codes used in the original Chan and Goldthorpe (2004) analysis. To keep all analysis consistent, the 2001 survey was used that has SOC 90 rather than SOC 2000 codes.</p>

<p>We now conduct the multidimensional scaling, keeping with Chan and Goldthorpe (2004), we keep the number of dimensions at 3 - though unlike their paper, we will only focus on the dimension that best represents homophily. The stress levels are provided alongside figures of each dimension combination.</p>
<p>Stress values for occupational titles have an average of 0.16 after three dimensions and sit between a range of 0.09 and 0.42. Figure 1.1 details a scree plot of eigenvalues demonstrating the three-dimensional selection.</p>

<p>Now we have the dimension, recorded in dimension 1 - similar to Chan and Goldthorpe (2004) that appears to be a solid representation of homophily. From this we can now move on to constructing the rest of the social status measure.</p>
<p>Dimension 1 of the MDSCAL analysis appears to clearly represent a dimension of homophily. In figure 1.2, clear instances of homophilic practice appear. For example, occupations RWS and SW, routine service workers and sales workers are very close within dimension 1 but are some of the furthest apart from TPE, or teachers and other professionals in education. General managers and administrators (GMA) are situated closely to Associate professionals in business (APB) but are very far away from Plant and machine operatives (PMO). This homophilic identification appears to see those concretely defined manual working occupations on the left-hand side of dimension 1 and those concretely defined non-manual working occupations on the right hand side. Those that exhibit partial forms of either are situated around 0 on the dimension 1 scale. What Chan expresses as a prima facie expression of status can at this stage be described as homophily – in that those individuals from similar occupational backgrounds appear to be married to one another. Whilst using different definitions, these results line up with Chan and other scholars.</p>
<p>I also concur with Chan’s conclusions that dimension 2 appears to be an expression of sex-based segregation within occupations. Those that are more traditionally male dominated are on the top half of the dimension 2 and those that are traditionally female dominated in the bottom half. Those occupations that see little sex segregation like record clerks are situated near 0. Dimension 3 follows Chan’s interpretation also.</p>
<p>Following the MCDSCAL analysis external statistical tests are called for by Chan to validate the claim that dimension 1 is an expression of social status rather than that of homophily. This is a misunderstanding of the abilities of MDSCAL as a method. MDSCAL as a method is a data reduction technique, one in which this case, a matrix of similarity or dissimilarity is entered and based upon the eigenvalues a certain number of dimensions are provided that express this matrix in Euclidean space. MDSCAL cannot provide evidence for a measure of social status, it can provide dimensions of data reduction based upon a given matrix. Identification of a manual/non-manual divide and marriage similarity patterns are justifiable due to externally validated statistics being an adequate source of evidence to strengthen claims that dimension 1 is an expression of homophily, and dimension 2 is an expression of manual/non-manual division – which is what Chan does to justify dimension 2s existence. Making a claim to social status is untenable, and attempting to justify it with external statistical tests on variables as Chan does is a data dredging exercise. To prove this point, I present subsequent duplications of analysis from Chan’s original paper providing their original results, alongside results of my measure, and the mean CAMSIS score of each occupational grouping. The data presented makes a strong case that these three measures are very similar to one another, and as such either all are a measure of social status – which is a near impossible case to prove, or the much easier assumption to accept, is that they are all measures of social distance or homophily.</p>

<p>The construction of social status requires summary measures of each Weberian strand of status. These are defined as cultural consumption, monopolistic aquisition, and social intercourse. These summary measures are constructed and then a factor analysis is produced to identify the latent factors within all measures to extract a social status measure.</p>
<p>To produce an adequate Weberian measure of social distance other attributes beyond occupational homophily or social distance are required. Factor analysis provides a solution to extract the relevant latent attributes of these variables that I define as: Homophily, Cultural Consumption, Friendship Closeness, and Monopolistic Acquisition. The first of these measures has already been constructed via MDSCAL analysis and the first dimension is reasonably assumed to be a measure of social distance. The second measure: cultural consumption is created through the work of Bourduisan inspired consumption practices as operationalised in Savage et al(Savage, Warde and Devine, 2005; Bourdieu, 2013; Payne, 2013; Savage et al., 2013). Two summary measures are created that produce a sum of highbrow cultural consumption and emerging cultural consumption. The latter is constructed from variables related to how often an individual watches sport [bj_lactb], goes to the cinema [bj_lactc], goes out drinking [bj_lactf], and does DIY around the house [bj_lacti]. The highbrow consumption variable is constructed from variables related to playing sport [bj_lacta], going to the theatre [bj_lactd], eating out at restaurants [bj_lacte], gardening [bj_lacth], attend evening classes [bj_lactj], attend local groups [bj_lactk], and volunteer [bj_lactl].</p>
<p>Closeness to friends was created through three identical measures of friendship relations. Each variable asks the individual how often do you interact with your 1st [bj_netph_1], 2nd [bj_netph_2], and 3rd [bj_netph_3] closest friends. This was generated into a summary measure of closeness.</p>
<p>Finally, the monopolistic acquisition measure is produced via sum measure of monopolistic traits on certain rewards and resources. Four variables were used: whether the individual possessed a degree [bj_qfedhi], whether or not they were a salaries or hourly paid worker [bj_paytyp_bh, bj_mrjsemp], whether or not they were a manual or non-manual worker [bj_jbsoc90_cc], and whether or not the individual had ever been in receipt of welfare [bj_jbub]. This sum measure created a monopolistic acquisition sum.</p>
<p>These five latent variables are z standardised so that no one variable has more weight than any other. These variables where then used to conduct exploratory factor analysis (exploratory as the structure is unknown). The factor analysis was rotated using orthogonal varimax rotation. This involves scaling the loadings by dividing them by the corresponding communality. Two factors were retained with an eigen value above one as seen via the screeplot in figure XXXX. Factor one loads all variables well except for emerging cultural consumption. Factor one going forward will be used as our latent measure of social status.</p>

<p>Two factors are retained. On inspection of the rotated factor loadings, Factor 1 loads all but emerging cultural consumption well (&gt;0.4). This makes some sense due to recent evidence presented by Friedman and Reeves (2024) identifying the loss of emerging consumption as a viable stratifying mechanism whilst highbrow consumption remains relevant. Another interesting phenomena is the negative loading of social intercourse. The higher ones status the less frequently they appear to engage in social intercourse. This appears to relate to strong ties networks that elites and high status individuals engage in as forms of social closure to protect their status positions.</p>
<p>Factor 1 appears to be our social status measure. I extract this variable and produce some basic descriptive tests.</p>

<p>Social status is compared in a similar way to the Chan-Goldthorpe scale to both aggregate income and proportions of A’levels. Similar to the analysis in Chan and Goldthorpe (2004) there is a moderate correlation between social status and median income, though importantly there are some clear outliers here. Specialist managers (SM) for example have higher median income relative to their social status, Childcare workers (CCW) have a much lower median income relative to their social status. The correlation between social status and proportion of A’levels is very high at 0.89. This is understandably due to the inclusion of degree ownership within the latent social status measure. Here too however there are some important outliers. Scientists, Engineers, and technologists (SET) have a higher proportion of A’levels relative to their social status, the reverse is true for Secretaries and receptionists (SEC).</p>

<p>Similar to the Chan-Goldthorpe measure, my social status measure has a clear relationship between itself and social class. The figure above details the median and interquartile range of social status mapped onto NS-SEC. Whilst there is clearly a relationship present, most notably those white collar NS-SEC categories, NS-SEC 1.1-3 have a higher median social status score compared to their blue collar counterparts. Having said that the distribution of social status amongst social class is not a linear affair, as noted earlier, a member from NS-SEC 7 can have a positive social status standing and a member from NS-SEC 1.1 can have a negative social status standing.</p>

<p>To provide further information on the relationship between class and status the figure above details the composition of each class in terms of occupational categories as ordered by social status. The status spread within each NS-SEC category is quite extensive even if there are clusters of high, medium, and low status occupations within specific NS-SEC categories.</p>
<p>Unlike Chan and Goldthorpe (2004), we adjust for complex survey design using appropriate weights for further regression analysis.</p>

<p>The table above produces three linear regression models using the Chan-Goldthorpe scale, my social status measure, and the Cambridge scale as dependent variables against median income and proportion of A’levels measures outlined above. The rankings derived from both my own measure and the Chan-Goldthorpe measure produce near identical results – there is some substantive difference in the Cambridge scale however. In this rudimentary regression model, the conclusions found from Chan and Goldthorpe (2004) hold for my measure as well. If these findings are duplicated across multiple models then this would provide strong evidence against the use of my measure. The conclusion would be that the addition of other Weberian measures to social status does not capture a more definitive variance in the form of social status. If however differences emerge, there is a strong case to use my measure over the Chan-Goldthorpe scale, as variance is being captured through the addition of other Weberian concepts added to my measure that is absent in their own. Chan and Goldthorpe do however provide much of the groundwork and evidence to suggest that a measure based on this Weberian construction is sufficiently different from Duncan’s SEI and Ganzeboom and Treiman’s occupational status scale (Blau and Duncan, 1967; Ganzeboom and Treiman, 2003; Chan and Goldthorpe, 2004).</p>

<p>The case that this measure is sociologically more compelling has been made. Hitherto, there has yet to be strong evidence to suggest that my measure is in fact more effective in capturing Weberian social status than the Chan-Goldthorpe measure. The next step is to provided evidence to suggest that this measure provides substantively different results from the Chan-Goldthorpe measure. If that holds true then their argument that occupations and occupations alone are all that is required to measure social status holds, and the need for this new measure is not needed. If that does not hold, then the latent features underpinning this new measure of social status appear to be capturing some element of status that the original Chan-Goldthorpe measure fails to account for. This paper first conducts a variety of models based on key assumptions underpinning Weberian social status. Models related to cultural consumption, social behaviour and social attitudes are conducted to assess the similarities or differences present between my social status measure and the Chan-Goldthorpe measure. The Cambridge scale is included as a vital comparison measure. A model on life chances is also included to provide a suitable test of my social status measure – social status should have no impact on economic life chances as Weber defines this as a social class-based concept. These first set of models are simplistic models that only include measures of social class, and the given status measure. For non-linear models, relevant KHB analysis is taken place to assess rescaling as a potential limiting factor in comparing nested non-linear models.</p>
<p>After these models are interpreted, this paper then turns to the British Social Attitudes Survey of 2002 to duplicate prior analysis by Chan and Goldthorpe (2007) looking at left-right and libertarian-authoritarian axis. I attempt to duplicate their analysis, then compare with my own social status measure to assess differences.</p>

<p>The first model presented in teh table above is a logistic regression model looking at a specific type of consumption practice – smoking. The dependent variable smoking status [bj_smoker] is a binary indicator of if an individual has never smoked or not. The initial null model with just social class presents a clear story, there is a class-based effect of class membership and smoking status. For those blue-collar workers, they have a lower log odds to never have smoked compared to NS-SEC 2. This class effect almost entirely disappears when my social status measure is included in the model. Only NS-SEC 1.2 and NS-SEC 7, the extremes of social class schema remain significant. The substantive effect transfers from a class-based effect to a status-based effect. As social status increases the log likelihood that an individual has never smoked also increases. This ‘switch’ from a class to status-based effect does not occur when using the Chan-Goldthorpe measure. Only NS-SEC 4 is insignificant in the Chan-Goldthorpe model compared to the null model. According to the Chan-Goldthorpe model smoking status is influenced by social status and social class. This theoretically goes against the core arguments of Weberian distinctions between social status and social class. Cultural consumption patterns are determined by status in the Weberian tradition. The Cambridge scale model presents a near identical interpretation to my own social status model.</p>

<p>The next model is another logistic regression, this time purporting to measure social behaviour. Another binary dependent variable, this time a variable of voting status [bj_vote7] indicating if a person has voted in the last general election or not. A similar pattern emerges. The initial null model with only social class presents a clear social class effect on voting status, with those from blue collar occupations having a higher log likelihood of not voting compared to NS-SEC 2. This class effect all but disappears with the exception of NS-SEC 3 and NS-SEC 7 when my social status measure is introduced. As social status increases, there is a decreased log likelihood for individuals to have not voted in the most recent election. Whilst my own social status measure and the Chan-Goldthorpe measure produce similar point estimates, the social class effect once more remains for the Chan-Goldthorpe model compared to my own social status model. These models suggest that voting apathy or behaviour is a matter of social status over social class. That is captured within my social status measure but not the Chan-Goldthorpe model, even though their point estimates remain similar.</p>

<p>The next set of models focuses on forms of social attitudes. These models focus on a particular attitude question asked of BHPS members. A Likert scale is constructed based on the response to the prompt that it is ‘unfair that wealth buys medical priority’ [bj_ophlc]. Ordinal logistic regressions are produced for each social status measure. The null model with NS-SEC suggests a modest class-based effect present. Particularly those at the most privileged end of NS-SEC have a higher log odds of strongly disagreeing to this statement compared to NS-SEC 2. The addition of my social status measure actually produces a stronger social class effect across the NS-SEC schema, making all but one category of NS-SEC (4) significant. Those in blue collar occupations as well as NS-SEC 3 all have a decreased log likelihood of strongly agreeing to this statement compared to NS-SEC 2. In addition to the stronger class effect, there is also a social status impact. As social status increases there is a decreased log likelihood of strongly disagreeing to this statement. What is interesting in this model is that it clearly demonstrates the differences between social class and social status. For those at the very top of the status scale, they are more likely to strongly disagree with such a statement, whereas those at the top of the class schema are most likely to disagree with such a statement. A similar effect is reported using the Chan-Goldthorpe measure, though does not capture NS-SEC 7. The Cambridge scale does not report a significant finding.</p>

<p>Economic life chances should not have any relationship to social status according to Weber. These next set of models test this assumption against all three scales. These models use a logistic regression model with a dependent variable of unemployment measuring if an individual in the past year has undergone a single spell of unemployment or not. The null model with social class presents a clear social class based effect. The social class effect is not disrupted by the inclusion of either my own social status variable or the Chan-Goldthorpe scale but is by the Cambridge scale. Importantly all three scales do not report significance. My measure can adequately be argued to be an effective measure of social status that does not have an influence on economic life chances.</p>

<p>Finally, the next set of models uses an ordinal logistic regression model on a Likert scale of views towards homosexuality [bj_opfamr]. This is the last set of models using the BHPS data. The initial null model plus social class appears to present a clear social class effect at the blue-collar level. Blue collar occupations have a decreased log likelihood strongly disagreeing to the view that homosexual relationships are wrong. The introduction of my social status measure nearly wipes away the class effect and suggests that most all of the influence comes from social status rather than social class. As social status increases there is an increased likelihood to strongly disagree with the statement that homosexual relationships are wrong. Identical findings are reported in the Chan-Goldthorpe model.</p>

<p>All models produced so far have been simplistic constructions that solely use NS-SEC and social status. These next set of models attempt to produce a ‘real life’ model example that would be published in academic literature. These models seek to duplicate analysis from Chan and Goldthorpe (2007). They create models based on the determinants of political attitudes on left-right and libertarian-authoritarian scales using linear regression. These models use the 2002 British Social Attitudes Survey. By using the useful appendix of their article, the models have been reconstructed. The sole difference is that my analysis uses the 2001 British Social Attitudes Survey for one important reason. The original analysis produced via Chan and Goldthorpe (2004), and my own analysis uses the BHPS wave 10 dataset that uses SOC 90 codes. The 2001 British Social Attitudes survey uses SOC 90 codes, where the 2002 survey uses SOC 2000 codes. This should require a re-analysis of a social status measure using the new SOC codes. For consistency, I continue to use the SOC 90 codes and so duplicate their work in the 2001 survey.</p>
<p>The dependent variable left-right was constructed through a variety of measures consisting of Likert scales on statements that the government should redistribute wealth [redistrb], big business benefits owners [bigbusnn], workers don’t get a fair share of wealth [wealth], one law for rich and another for poor [richlaw], and management will always try to get the better of employees if it gets the chance [indust4]. Independent variables consist of age [rage] between the ages 18-97, sex [rsex], household income [hhincome], highest educational qualification [hedqual], current NS-SEC [rnssec], and each model contains either my social status measure or the Chan-Goldthorpe scale, once more z standardised for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>The second dependent variable libertarian-authoritarian was constructed through similar Likert variables on statements that young people today don’t have enough respect for traditional British values [tradvals], people who break the law should be given stiffer sentences [stifsent], for some crimes, the death penalty is appropriate [deathapp], schools should teach children to obey [obey], the law should always be obeyed [wronglaw], censorship of films and magazines is necessary to uphold moral standards [censor]. This model also includes all independent variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>The left-right models are representative of economic life chances and so both social status measures should not unduly influence the model. Both models present identical results. Neither social status measure is statistically significant. This presents evidence that both measures adequately capture the Weberian notion that social status has little to no influence on individual economic life chances. The second set of models assessing libertarian-authoritarian axis has no social class-based effect and both measures of social status are statistically significant. There is however a large difference between the two models. My social status measure has a point estimate that is 55 percent larger than the Chan-Goldthorpe scale.</p>

<p>The size of this difference is better represented through marginal effects. The predicted probabilities at means are presented for each social status measure in each model. The probabilities are presented in figure XXXX. As can be seen the larger point estimate of my social status measure shows a much steeper gradient comparative to the Chan-Goldthorpe measure. The Chan-Goldthorpe measure presents the view that across the status scale there is a range of 13.48 to 14.21 on the authoritarian axis. For my social status measure there is a range of 13.17 to 14.69. My social status measure sees an extension on both extreme ends of the range of the authoritarian axis. Using my measure of social status, you would conclude that there is a larger influence of social status on the libertarian-authoritarian axis. Some may argue that this difference is relatively small, however this model amongst prior models have made it clear that my status measure appears to capture more ‘status’ through its addition of Weberian status concepts compared to the simple measure deployed by Chan-Goldthorpe.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this paper I have outlined current issues with Weberian constructions of social status as they exist in the Chan-Goldthorpe scale. This paper has outlined the theoretical issues with the partially Weberian operationalisation of social status and have provided an appropriate sociological justification for the inclusion of other aspects of Weberian social status to be included in any measure of status. This paper then follows a research programme adopting my theoretical recommendations into a newly operationalised measure of social status that is based in part on the original work coined by Chan and Goldthorpe (2004, 2007). Combining a MDSCAL method of homophily based on marriage occupational similarity with a factor analysis combining important aspects of Weberian social status: cultural consumption, friendship closeness, and monopolistic acquisition produces in this papers view an appropriate measure of social status that adequately captures the Weberian determinants of status that prior measures leave out. This construction is then directly compared with the Chan-Goldthorpe scale and the Cambridge scale to assess the relative similarity/difference in their use for statistical inference. This comparison is done in a variety of ways. Firstly, a basic assessment and comparison of my measure with education, income, and social class sees a relatively similar outcome to that of the Chan-Goldthorpe scale. On closer inspection using multiple different models assessing key elements of social status related to: cultural consumption, behaviours, attitudes, and life chances presents clear differences between my own measure and the Chan-Goldthorpe scale. These differences, in this papers view, are attributable to my social status measure being better capable of capturing the salient qualities of Weberian social status. In particular these differences appear in the form of wiping away social class-based effects compared to the Chan-Goldthorpe scale, and in certain models presenting a more sensitive overall measure of social status. In key areas both measures present identical results – in the case of life chances, but in areas of like attitudes, behaviours, and consumption, my status measure appears to be more sensitivity and salient to Weberian social status compared to the Chan-Goldthorpe scale.</p>
<p>There are several areas of limitations regarding the social status measure presented in this paper. The first concerns the lack of loading of emerging cultural consumption to the status measure. This may be a result of inappropriate or lack of sufficient emerging cultural consumption measures within the BHPS that thereby limits the loading used in the factor analysis. Recent analysis however appears to present an alternative view that emerging cultural consumption is no longer an effective proxy of social status as more and more elites consume emerging cultural aspects (Friedman and Reeves, 2024). Highbrow cultural consumption according to Friedman and Reeves (2024) continues to be a stratifying influence and also provides evidence as to why my highbrow measure loads well onto social status but the emerging measure does not.</p>
<p>The second limitation rests on the measures used to produce a friendship closeness variable. Weber speaks to closeness as a matter of ‘who you would sit down and eat dinner with’. No measure like this exists within the BHPS. The best alternative was a variety of measures related to how close an individual is with their best friends. This presented an interesting result whereby the less close individuals are with their best friends the higher social status that individual typically has. This specific role needs greater investigation.</p>
<p>The final weakness identified in this paper relates to social status only being constructed under a SOC 90 framework. For this status measure to be widely adopted, serval social status measures need to be constructed using multiple SOC versions. This is possible, though different surveys may need to be utilised to achieve this goal.</p>
