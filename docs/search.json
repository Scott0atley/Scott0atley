I am particularly interested in social stratification, social class, and social mobility. The key substantive focus of my research is the sociology of social stratification. My research draws on a range of quantitative methodological techniques, including but not limited to: logistic regression, continuation ratio models, sensitivity analysis, and multiple imputation. My research mainly uses longitudinal birth cohort data.\nMy PhD examines the role structural inequality has upon choice and opportunity for youth entering into the world of economic activity for the first time post-mandatory education. I study this impact within two birth cohorts - the National Childhood Development Study and the British Cohort Study. I also use the UK Household Longitudinal Study to construct synthetic cohorts to cover a period of time whereby no birth cohort data is present. My PhD also compares cross-cohort differences within a socio-historical context.\nOn this website, you will find information on my research. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
